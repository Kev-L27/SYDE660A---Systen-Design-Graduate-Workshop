# SYDE660A---Systen-Design-Graduate-Workshop
Me and my teammates worked closely in this course to develop a face mask detection model that could detect, given an image of a person, whether 1) mask is worn properly, 2)mask is not worn properly(nose not covered), 3)mask is not worn properly(both nose and mouth are not covered), 4)mask is not worn. 
And we ended up having the model making predictions with an accuracy of 98% and an average processing speed of 0.63 second.
